You can know more about me in the [homepage](/). This blog site, as its name indicates, is about clinical SAS programming. It is particularly focused on SAS. I often update my old posts (even after years) to correct errors and remove outdated information, so please do not take everything for granted.

This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template forked from [Yihui](https://github.com/yihui/en). It was originally derived from the site [setImpl](http://lhzhang.com/) by Linghua Zhang. You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.
